# DevReward Program

Welcome to the Casper Association's DevReward Program. The purpose of this program is to improve the Casper ecosystem through your valuable inputs. This repository serves as the documentation and resource hub for the program, providing you with all the necessary information to contribute your ideas and collaborate with the Casper ecosystem teams. As you help address the areas open for improvement within the ecosystem, you will be rewarded with CSPR tokens.

With any questions reach out to [nicolasz@casper.network](mailto:nicolasz@casper.network)

### How to Set Up a Proposal for a DevReward

If you have a proposal for a DevReward, which can be described as an idea to improve the Casper Ecosystem and encourages developers to implement it by offering a reward in CSPR tokens, then you can easily gain access to the GitHub [Issue Form](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/developer-rewards/issues/new/choose).

Please try to describe the proposal as accurately as possible, providing examples such as links, if applicable.

### Scope of the DevRewards

- The DevReward Program aims to generate rewards within the range of USD 100 to USD 1,000 per DevReward at maximum. 
<!--- All existing DevRewards are listed on the following webpage, and anyone can participate in the work.
-->
- Once a DevReward is completed, the Casper Association will review it against the acceptance criteria, and the reward will be paid out to the developer. 
- All DevRewards are paid out in CSPR Tokens as per the calculation available [here](https://www.emergingte.ch/casper-prices/?cpage=1).

### Workflow

#### DevReward Proposal Submission

- Any individual with an idea and identification of missing parts in the Casper ecosystem can submit their DevReward proposal via the GitHub Form. 
- This program has been designed for developer teams who are actively building on the Casper public network and/or for teams or individuals who have a deep understanding of the network's code structure. If you wish to contribute to the open-source code and are skilled in bug fixing, you can participate and get rewarded for your contributions.

#### Assessment of the DevReward Proposal

- The Casper Association members will evaluate the DevReward proposal to determine its applicability and suitability for implementation, considering predefined acceptance criteria.

#### Publishing the DevReward and Readiness for Work

- Once the DevReward proposal is assessed and approved, it will be published on the webpage, indicating that it is ready for implementation **Webpage coming end of June**. 
- Interested individuals can choose a DevReward to work on based on their interests and skills.
- Only DevRewards with the tag "Open" indicated on GitHub are ready to be worked on and are considered for evaluation in terms of deliveries.

#### Delivery of Work and Review

- After completing the assigned work, developers can send their deliverables to the following mail adress: devrewards@casper.network
- The Casper Association will review the submitted work to ensure it meets the specified criteria.
- If the review was successful, the developer will receive an email with quick feedback and a request to send the CSPR address where the reward can be sent to.

### Payout of CSPR Rewards

- If the delivered DevReward successfully meets the acceptance criteria and passes the review process, the developer will receive the corresponding amount of CSPR rewards as payment.

## FAQ for Developers - DevReward Program

**How can I set up a proposal for a DevReward?**

To set up a proposal, you can access the GitHub Issue Form by following the provided link. Please describe your proposal accurately, providing examples and relevant links if applicable.

**What is the scope of DevRewards in terms of value?**

The DevReward Program aims to generate rewards ranging from USD 100 to a maximum of USD 1,000 per DevReward. All existing DevRewards can be found on the provided webpage, and anyone can participate in the implementation of the proposed improvement ideas.

**What if my proposal for a DevReward exceeds the maximum value scope of USD 1,000?**

If your proposal for a DevReward exceeds the USD 1,000 value scope, it is recommended to try and split it into smaller packages that fit within the scope. If that's not possible, please provide a detailed explanation of why the proposed infrastructure is necessary. The proposal will be assessed, and alternative options, such as a grant proposal, may be explored to find a solution.

**Who decides the pricing of DevRewards?**

The pricing of DevRewards is decided by a technical expert at the Casper Association. While an initial suggestion during the proposal stage is appreciated, the final pricing decision is made by the technical expert who takes into account various factors to determine the appropriate pricing for the DevReward.

**Is there an incentive structure for proposals of DevRewards?**

The primary benefit of every proposal should be the corresponding solution it offers. The main goal of this DevReward program is to close gaps in the Casper ecosystem, making it easier for developers to build upon. The focus is on fostering community-driven contributions that benefit the community as a whole. The incentive lies in the opportunity to contribute to the growth and improvement of the ecosystem, creating a more robust and developer-friendly environment. You can work on the DevReward which you proposed to deliver a solution and get rewarded for your contribution.

**What happens once a DevReward is completed?**

The Casper Association will review the completed DevReward against the acceptance criteria. If it meets the criteria, the corresponding reward will be paid out to the developer. All DevRewards are labeled in USD and paid out in CSPR Tokens as per the price setting formula available [here](https://www.emergingte.ch/casper-prices/?cpage=1).

**Is it allowed to submit a proposal for a DevReward and start working on the solution once it is accepted?**

Yes, it is allowed and encouraged to work on the solution as soon as the proposal for a DevReward is accepted. This approach ensures that the initiator of the proposal can actively participate in the development process.

**Can a proposal be submitted for a DevReward that has already been implemented?**

DevReward proposals are only considered for issues that have not been implemented yet. Proposals referring to already existing ideas have a high likelihood of being rejected.

**What is the process if another developer completes and delivers a DevReward before me?**

The process follows a "first come, first served" approach. If multiple developers deliver their solutions in a short period and both solutions align with the acceptance criteria, the rewards will be paid out to both developers in full. This is at the discretion of the Casper Association responsible parties.

**How long does the assessment process for a DevReward proposal typically take?**

The assessments are currently planned on a biweekly basis, and therefore, the process is expected to be completed within 2 weeks.

**Are there any specific technical requirements or programming languages that developers should consider when working on a DevReward?**

This depends on the specific DevReward. Please refer to the DevReward specification for more details.

**Is there any limit to the number of DevRewards a developer can work on simultaneously?**

There is no limit to the number of DevRewards a developer can work on simultaneously. However, it is recommended not to delay the work once a DevReward is ready, as it follows a "first come, first served" basis.

**Are there any specific licenses or intellectual property considerations related to the work done for a DevReward?**

The code delivered should support the Casper ecosystem and be based on an open-source framework. Therefore, no licenses or property considerations can be claimed.


**Can developers participate in multiple rounds of the DevReward Program?**

Developers can participate in the DevReward Program for as long as they want and on as many rewards as they desire. There are no restrictions on participation.

**Can developers propose DevRewards that involve collaborations with external projects or organizations?**

It is not recommended to involve third parties in DevReward proposals. The code should be open source in the end. Proposals involving third-party collaborations have a higher chance of being rejected.

**How frequently are the CSPR rewards paid out to developers upon successful completion of a DevReward?**

The assessments and payout of CSPR rewards are also planned on a biweekly basis, aligning with the assessment process.
