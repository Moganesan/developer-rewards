      placeholder: Prepare a simple web UI (preferably React) with a button that people can press to get X amount of Token, redeemable only once every 24h.  A similar solution we have for the $CSPR native token on the testnet. We want an easier way of token distribution. UI should be in the form of an injectable component.
